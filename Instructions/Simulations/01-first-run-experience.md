# Explore the first run experience

In this exercise, you go through the first run experience of Microsoft Copilot for Security.

- You're logged in as the fictitious user, Avery Howard, and have a global administrator role in Microsoft Entra.
- You'll provision Microsoft Copilot for Security with one security compute unit (SCU).
- You'll work in both the Azure portal and the standalone experience of Microsoft Copilot for Security.

This exercise should take approximately **10** minutes to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> The environment for this exercise is based on a simulation, generated from pre-determined screen captures of the actual product. As a limited simulation, links on a page may not be enabled and text-based inputs that fall outside of the specified script are not be supported.

> [!NOTE]
> When a lab instruction calls for opening a link to the simulated environment, it is generally recommended that you open the link in a new browser window so that you can simultaneously view the instructions and the exercise environment. To do so, select the right mouse key and select the option.

### Task: Set role permissions

Before users can start using Copilot, admins need to provision and allocate capacity. To provision capacity:

- You must have an Azure subscription.
- You need to be an Azure owner or Azure contributor, at a resource group level, as a minimum.

In this task, you walk through the process of ensuring you have the appropriate role permissions. This starts by enabling access management for Azure resources.

Why is this needed? As a Global Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID, you might not have access to all subscriptions and management groups in your directory. Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resources are secured independently from one another. That is, Microsoft Entra role assignments don't grant access to Azure resources, and Azure role assignments don't grant access to Microsoft Entra ID. When you elevate your access, you're assigned the User Access Administrator role in Azure at root scope (/). This allows you to view all resources and assign access in any subscription or management group in the directory. For details, see [Elevate access to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups.](/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin).

Once you're assigned the User Access Administrator role in Azure, you can assign a user the necessary access to provision SCUs for Copilot.  For the purpose of this exercise only, which is to show you the steps involved,  you will be assigning your the necessary access.  The steps that follow will guide you through the process.

1. Open the simulated environment by selecting this link: **[Azure portal](https://app.highlights.guide/start/6373500f-1f10-4584-a14e-ca0b4aa7399f?link=1&token=40f793d4-2956-40a4-b11a-6b3d4f92557f&azure-portal=true)**.

1. You'll start by enabling Access management for Azure resources. To access this setting:
    1. From the Azure portal, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
    1. From the left navigation panel, expand **Manage**.
    1. From the left navigation panel, scroll down and select **Properties**.
    1. Enable the toggle switch for **Access management for Azure resources**, then select **Save**..

1. Now that you can view all resources and assign access in any subscription or management group in the directory, assign yourself the Owner role for the Azure subscription.
    1. From the blue banner on the top of the page, select **Microsoft Azure** to return to the landing page of the Azure portal.
    1. Select **Subscriptions** then select the subscription listed **Woodgrove - GTP Demos (Exernal/Sponsored)**.
    1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.
    1. Select **Add**, then **Add role assignment**.
    1. From the Role tab, select **Privileged administrator roles**.
    1. Select **Owner**.
    1. Select **+ Select members**.
    1. Select **Avery Howard**.
    1. Select **Allow user to assign all roles except privileged administrator roles, Owner, UAA, RBAC (Recommended)**.
    1. Select **Review + assign**.

As an owner to the Azure subscription, you'll now be able to provision capacity within Copilot.

### Task: Provision capacity

In this task, you go through the steps of provisioning capacity for your organization. There are two options for provisioning capacity:

- Provision capacity within Copilot for Security (recommended)
- Provision capacity through Azure

For this exercise, you provision capacity through Copilot for Security. When you first open Copilot for Security, a wizard guides you through the steps in setting up capacity for your organization.

1. Open the simulated environment by selecting this link: **[Microsoft Copilot for Security](https://app.highlights.guide/start/6373500f-1f10-4584-a14e-ca0b4aa7399f?link=0&token=40f793d4-2956-40a4-b11a-6b3d4f92557f&azure-portal=true)**.


1. Open the browser tab for **Microsoft Copilot for Security**.
1. Follow the steps in the Wizard, select **Get started**.
1. On this page, you set up your security capacity. For any of the fields listed below, you can select the information icon for more information.
    1. Azure subscription: From the drop-down, select **Woodgrove - GTP Demos (External/Sponsored)**.
    1. Resource group: From the drop-down, select **RG-1**.
    1. Capacity name: Enter a capacity name.
    1. Prompt evaluation location [Geo]: From the drop-down, select your region.
    1. You can choose whether you want to select the option, "If this location has too much traffic, allow Copilot to evaluate prompts anywhere in the world (recommended for optimal performance).
    1. Capacity region is set based on location selected.
    1. Security compute: This field is automatically populated with the minimum required SCU units, which is 1. Leave  field with the value of **1**.
    1. Select the box, **"I acknowledge that I have read, understood, and agree to the Terms and Conditions**.
    1. Select **Continue** on the bottom right corner of the page.

1. The wizard displays information about where your customer data will be stored. The region displayed is based on the region you selected in the Prompt evaluation field. Select **Continue**.
    1. If you want to learn more about how Microsoft protects your data, selected **protects your data**. This opens a separated browser tab. When you're done reviewing this information, select the Microsoft Copilot for Security browser tab to continue the setup.
1. Once the SCU is provisioned, the next page in the wizard is to allocate that capacity. Select the drop-down and select the capacity that was configured.
1. The next screen is where you can select options to help improve Copilot. You can select the toggle based on your preferences.
    1. If you want to learn more about Copilot privacy and data security, select **Copilot for Security privacy and data security**. This opens a separated browser tab. When you're done reviewing this information, select the Microsoft Copilot for Security browser tab to continue the setup.
1. In the next page, you're informed of the default roles that can access Copilot (youâ€™ll add users in a subsequent exercise). Select **Continue**.
1. You're all set! Select **Finish**.
1. Close the browser tab, as the next exercise will use a separate link to the lab-like environment.

### Review

In this exercise, you successfully provisioned Copilot for Security. You're now ready to move to the next exercise where you'll explore the core functionality of Microsoft Copilot for Security.
