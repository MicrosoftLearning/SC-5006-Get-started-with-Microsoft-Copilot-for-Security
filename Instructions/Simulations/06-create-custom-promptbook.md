# Create a custom promptbook

In this exercise, you create a custom promptbook from an existing session and then run that promptbook.

- You're logged in as the fictitious user, Avery Howard, and have the Copilot owner role.
- You'll work in the standalone experience of Microsoft Copilot for Security.

This exercise should take approximately **10** minutes to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> The environment for this exercise is based on a simulation, generated from pre-determined screen captures of the actual product. As a limited simulation, links on a page may not be enabled and text-based inputs that fall outside of the specified script are not be supported.

> [!NOTE]
> When a lab instruction calls for opening a link to the simulated environment, it is generally recommended that you open the link in a new browser window so that you can simultaneously view the instructions and the exercise environment. To do so, select the right mouse key and select the option.

### Task: Create the promptbook from an existing session

In this task, you create the promptbook. As part of the process, you templatize one of the prompts by editing the prompt with an input parameter, and then add a new prompt.

1. Open the simulated environment by selecting this link: **Microsoft Copilot for Security**.

1. There’s a session from earlier in the day that identified failed logins that you want to use. Since that session isn't listed on the landing page, select view all sessions.

1. Select the session labeled, "what are the last three failed logins." Scroll up/down to verify two prompts are listed.

1. To include a subset of all the prompts, you can select the box next to each individual prompt. Or you can select the box next to the pin icon to include all the prompts. In this case, you want to select all the prompts from the session.

1. Now that you’ve selected the prompts, select the Create promptbook icon ![sources icon](../media/create-promptbook-icon.png). The Create a promptbook window opens. Here you populate the specific information about the promptbook. For the simulation, use the right-arrow key to auto-populate the fields as follows.
    1. Name: Failed logins
    1. Tags: Microsoft Entra
    1. Description: Find the last failed logins
    1. The first prompt is to show the last three failed logins. To configure the number as an input parameter, select the edit icon next to the prompt.
        1. To configure the number as an input parameter, replace the word three with an easily understood parameter name. The input parameter name contains no spaces and is delineated with angle brackets. For this simulation, we do that for you, just select the first prompt.
        1. To confirm the edit, select the checkmark. The number parameter is now listed in the section labeled "Inputs you’ll need." For this promptbook, this is the only input needed, but you can create promptbooks that use multiple inputs.
    1. For your promptbook, you'll add a new prompt. Select + Add prompt.
        1. Select the edit icon.
        1. Use the right arrow key on your keyboard to populate the prompt field with the prompt "What are the authentication methods for the failed logins."
        1. Select the checkmark.
    1. The next step is to select who can use this promptbook. Select the drop-down to view the options. For now, leave the setting to Just me.
    1. To create the custom promptbook, select Create.
    1. With your promptbook created, you can choose to view the details, share the promptbook, or go to the promptbook library. Select go to the promptbook library.

### Task: Run the promptbook

In this task, you explore the options available for the newly created promptbook and run the promptbook.

1. Select My promptbooks.

1. Place your mouse over the newly created promptbook, until it's highlighted. With the promptbook highlighted select the ellipses to view the available options.

1. Select the run icon to start a new session. 
    1. You want Copilot to return information on the last two failed logins. Select the number field to autopopulate the number field with the value two.
    1. Select the run button.

1. Review the responses generated by Copilot.

### Review

In this exercise, you created a custom promptbook from an existing session and ran that promptbook.
