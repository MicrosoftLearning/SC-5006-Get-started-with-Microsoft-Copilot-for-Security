# SC-5006-Get-started-with-Microsoft-Copilot-for-Security

**Are you an MCT?** - Have a look at our [GitHub User Guide for MCTs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/MCT-User-Guide/)

## What are we doing?

This course uses interactive, lab-like simulations to help learners become familiar with the features and functionality of Microsoft Copilot for Security.  The simulations are included in the module [Explore use cases of Microsoft Copilot for Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/security-copilot-exercises/). The module is part of the Learning Path [Get started with Microsoft Copilot for Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/security-copilot-and-ai/) that is available on Microsoft Learn.

Simulations are based on screen captures.The steps provided in the simulation are based on the product's user interface (UI) at the time the simulation was recorded. Because the actual product user interface (UI) is continually evolving, the UI shown in the simulation and the associated steps to perform an action may not reflect the actual product UI.

Input or feedback to the contents of the exercise module, or any other module in the learning path, can be provided through Microsoft Learn.

## How should I use this repository??

This repository is used to hold sample files used in some of the simulation exercises. Learners may be prompted to download the sample file as part of a setup step, in an exercise.

An alternative to downloading a sample file used in an exercise, is to create a file, using the same name, locally on the user's PC. The contents of the file won't matter for the simulated exercise. The prompt responses shown in the simulation, however, are based on the actual file and for this reason it's important that trainers and learners have access to view and download the actual sample files.

## How do I contribute?

- Any MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainer) can submit a pull request to the content in the GitHub repro. Microsoft and the course author will then triage and include content changes as needed.

- You can submit bugs, changes, improvement, and ideas.
